- Since 4.73 the mutex control block has the size of std::uint32_t[4] (instead
  of std::uint32_t[3]) and the first word has the layout
      struct MutexControlBlockHeader
      {
          std::uint8_t controlBlockType;
          // The owner priority has been removed.
          std::uint16_t nestingLevel;
      };
